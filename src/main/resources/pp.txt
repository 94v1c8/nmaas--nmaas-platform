<h2><strong>NMaaS Privacy Notice</strong></h2>
<h4><strong>Description of the NMaaS Service</strong></h4>
<p><a href="https://www.geant.org/NMaaS" target="_blank">Network Management as a Service (NMaaS)</a> provides a
portfolio of network management applications run on a per-user, secured network monitoring infrastructure. </p>
<p>NMaaS simplifies domain network management by providing the infrastructure and tools via a cloud-based,
multi-tenant and secure network management system. It enables the deployment of network management tools,
as well as management and monitoring of client networks, although NMaaS does not monitor and manage the network by
itself. </p>

<h4><strong>Why We Process Personal Data</strong></h4>
<p>NMaaS processes personal data: <ul>
<li>to fulfill the service and user support processes; </li>
<li>for user authentication and authorization purposes; </li>
<li>for personalized notification purposes (email communication enabling the change of password,
email notification about events in the system relevant for user operations, e.g. deployed applications and
email notification about general events in the system, e.g. planned downtime, maintenance); </li>
<li>to monitor the use of the NMaaS service for security purposes; </li>
<li>to monitor the use of the NMaaS service for improved resource and performance optimizations; </li>
<li>to track personal data related events (new user registration, user data update and role assignment or revocation).
</li>
</ul></p>
<br>
<h4><strong>What Personal Data We Process</strong></h4>
<p>NMaaS user data is stored in a central relational database and application log files.</br>
The database contains the following user personal data:<ul>
<li><strong>username</strong>, </li>
<li><strong>user identifier</strong> – unique identifier assigned internally by NMaaS, </li>
<li><strong>user IdP identifier</strong> – unique identifier assigned by the Identity Provided used by the user to log in to the
NMaaS Portal (applicable if eduGAIN log in option is used), </li>
<li><strong>password</strong> – user password used to log in to the NMaaS Portal (applicable if user account is being registered
directly in NMaaS), </li>
<li><strong>first name</strong> (optional), </li>
<li><strong>last name</strong> (optional), </li>
<li><strong>email address</strong>. </li></ul></p>
<p>The service log files contain the following user personal data: username, user identifier, first name, last
name and email address. </p>
<p>The purpose of NMaaS is to facilitate automated deployment of network management and monitoring applications.
It should be noted that the data collected and stored by particular applications deployed through NMaaS is neither
controlled nor processed by NMaaS service and the NMaaS Operational Team however it might contain user personal data.
NMaaS does not take any responsibility for the data being collected and stored by those applications. </p>
<p>During the application deployment process NMaaS provides a configuration wizard functionality to ease the initial
setup of the application. Wizard prompts the user to provide different type of data about the equipment to be managed
depending on the application being deployed and this data may include for example device access credentials. It should
be noted that it is not advised to provide in the wizard any user personal data and use generic device access accounts
if possible. NMaaS does not take any responsibility for the data being provided by the user in the wizard. </p>
<br>
<h4><strong>Who Do We Share Data With?</strong></h4>
<p>Personal data persisted in the database and in the log files is processed according to the clearly defined goals
by the NMaaS service Operational Team and is not shared with any third party. </p>
<br>
<h4><strong>Personal Data Retention</strong></h4>
<p>NMaaS user personal data is retained in the database for the period in which particular user uses the service.
Since the moment of reception of user account removal request the data is still kept in the database for a period of
6 months after which it is removed. </p>
<p>Log files are retained for a period of 180 days. </p>
