	"fullDescriprion": "pmacct is a small set of multi-purpose passive network monitoring tools.\nIt can account, classify, aggregate, replicate and export forwarding-plane data,\nie. IPv4 and IPv6 traffic; collect and correlate control-plane data via BGP and BMP;\ncollect infrastructure data via streaming network telemetry.\n\npmacct main features are:\n- Suitable to ISP, IXP, CDN, IP carrier, Cloud, DC and hot-spots enviroments and SDN solutions\n- Runs on Linux, BSDs, Solaris and embedded systems\n- Support for both IPv4 and IPv6\n- Collects data through libpcap, Netlink/NFLOG, NetFlow v1/v5/v7/v8/v9, sFlow v2/v4/v5 and IPFIX\n- Collects streaming network telemetry data (from 1.6.0)\n- Supports Cisco NEL for CGNAT scenarios and Cisco NSEL\n- Saves data to a number of backends including:\n- Relational databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite\n- noSQL databases: MongoDB and BerkeleyDB\n- AMQP message exchanges: RabbitMQ\n- Kafka message brokers (from 1.5.3)\n- memory tables\n-- flat files\n- Exports data to remote collectors through IPFIX, NetFlow v5/v9 and sFlow v5\n- Replicates incoming IPFIX, NetFlow and sFlow packets to remote collectors\n- Flexible architecture to tag, filter, redirect, aggregate and split captured data\n- Embeds:\n-- BGP daemon for efficient visibility into the inter-domain routing plane.\n-- Supports BGP/MPLS VPNs rfc4364\n-- Supports BGP ADD-PATHS (draft-ietf-idr-add-paths) for visibility of BGP multi-path routes\n-- Can log live BGP messaging and/or dump BGP tables per peer at regular time interval\n- a BMP daemon to gain insight in BGP data, events and statistics\n- an IS-IS/IGP daemon for visibility of internal routes\n- Traffic streams classification.\n- Inspection of tunnelled traffic (ie. GTP)\n- GeoIP lookups leveraging Maxmind library\n- Pluggable architecture for easy integration of new capturing environments and data backends\n- Careful SQL support: data pre-processing, triggers, dynamic table naming\n- It's free, open-source, developed and supported with passion and open mind for more than 10 years",
