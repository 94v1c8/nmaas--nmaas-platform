<h4><strong>Description of the NMaas Service</strong></h4>
<p>
The eduGAIN interfederation service connects identity federations around the world, simplifying access to content,
services and resources for the global research and education community. The eduGAIN consortium is comprised of
many legal entities.
</p><p>
GÉANT is the body which is responsible for the international coordination and interoperability of the eduGAIN,
and operates a number of services for the eduGAIN consortium globally. These central services are maintained by
eduGAIN Operations Team (OT). <strong>This privacy policy concerns part of the eduGAIN consortium that is operated and
maintained by GÉANT</strong> including, but not limited to, the following services: eduGAIN metadata distribution service,
supporting tools available at the eduGAIN Technical site, secretarial services and support for eduGAIN users.
</p><p>
We are fans of privacy, and we are proud to say that the eduGAIN service is designed for minimal disclosure of
end users personal data. eduGAIN DOES NOT process or have access to any transaction between an Identity Provider
and Service Provider or any end user personal data as part of the authorisation process. eduGAIN provides advice
and guidance to Identity Providers and Service Providers on how to meet GDPR requirements as part of its
<a href="https://wiki.geant.org/display/eduGAIN/eduGAIN+GDPR+Impact+Assessment">Best Current Practice documentation.</a>

<h4><strong>Why We Process Personal Data</strong></h4>
<p>
eduGAIN processes personal data to support running the eduGAIN Steering Group and the administration of the
eduGAIN service.
</p><p>
eduGAIN processes a small amount of end user personal data to monitor use of its website for security and
statistical purposes.
</p><p>
eduGAIN processes personal data that is made available in metadata aggregates provided by identity federations
that participate in eduGAIN. This data is publicly available, but eduGAIN has specific permission to use this
metadata via the signed eduGAIN Declaration with each member federation.
</p><br>
<h4><strong>What Personal Data We Process</strong></h4>
<p>
eduGAIN processes the following information:
<ul>
    <li>Statistical information and logs for the edugain.org and technical.edugain.org website.
    We collect the <strong>usual web server logs</strong>, i.e. timestamp of access, IP address which
    requested the page, the page being requested, the HTML result code, etc.  GÉANT has a <strong>legitimate
    interest</strong> in this data processing.</li>
    <li><strong>Contact name, surname, email and affiliation</strong> of eduGAIN Steering Group contacts.
    eduGAIN asks for the <strong>consent</strong> of individuals on the Steering Group
    before publishing and using this data.</li>
    <li>Personal data made available by identity federations participating in eduGAIN in publicly available
    metadata streams is processed as part of the <a href="https://technical.edugain.org/entities" target="_blank">
    eduGAIN Technical Database</a> and the creation of the eduGAIN metadata
    aggregate. This data may include <strong>name, surname, email, phone number and affiliation</strong> to the entity.
    eduGAIN strongly advises identity federations to use function contacts rather than the personal ones.
    GÉANT has a <strong>legitimate interest</strong> in this data processing.</li>
</ul></p><br>
<h4><strong>Who Do We Share Data With?</strong></h4>

Operational Team for management and communication purposes.

eduGAIN Operations Team. This data may also be made publicly available on the eduGAIN Technical website with the
consent of the SG member in question.
</p><p>
Personal data in federation metadata is made publicly available by the identity federations in question.
